    "There is also an added understanding about dimensionality reduction in decision trees (and random forests as well).If you may recall the same concept in logistic regression, the idea was to penalize \"non-performing\" features by reducing their coefficients close to(alpha=0:Ridge) or equal to zero(alpha=1:Lasso).(P.S. There is also a provision for replicating the objective of train-test data partitioning, i.e. cross-validation). In decision trees, entropy and information gain parameters are calculated to ascertain the best attribute to split/ partition the tree. It is crucial to engender the tree a definitive structure, else the curse of biasness in decision trees for continuous and nominal data comes to play.   "
