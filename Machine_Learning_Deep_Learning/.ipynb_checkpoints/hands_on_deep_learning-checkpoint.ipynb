    "Machine learning has conquered our digital space in a much conceivable way. Aritifical Intelligence is the umbrella discipline that describes the varied notions of the systemic behavior akin to humans. Unlike the common held adage, **Deep Learning** isn't a part of Machine Learning per se, rather it has evolved to be an exclusive stream altogether.  \n",
    "If we recall from the previous session, we discussed the relevance of decision trees and random forests and how crucial former is to the latter. The diversity and aggregation of results in the random forests engender them the alacrity to handle multidimensional data. Although, neural nets do not foster the *same* relationship with deep learning, it is of the utmost importance to fathom the concept prior to proceeding to the holistic theme of deep learning. "
